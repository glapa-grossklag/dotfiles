# dotfiles

A collection of my dotfiles for:

* Zsh
* Vim & NeoVim
* i3
* GNU Make
* Zathura

## Installation

The symlink process is handled by [GNU
Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

```sh
git clone git@github.com:glapa-grossklag/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
bash ./install.sh
```

Note: `install.sh` does not install any of the programs, please use your
package manager of choice to do so.
